//When Deadlock Example runs, it's extremely likely that both threads will block when they attempt to invoke bowBack. 
//Neither block will ever end, because each thread is waiting for the other to exit bow.

//Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is 
//unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" 
//threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return. 
//If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the 
//same object will often be blocked.

//A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. 
//If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. 
//As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make further progress.
//However, the threads are not blocked â€” they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work.
